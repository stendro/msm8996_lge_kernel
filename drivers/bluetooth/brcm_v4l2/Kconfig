	  Shared transport driver for UART.
          This driver is required if you want to use BT/FM/Ant via
          shared UART. These could be enabled using below flags.

	  Say Y here to compile support for Broadcom shared transport driver
	  or say M to compile is as a module (brcm_ldisc).

	  Bluetooth protocol driver.
	  This driver is required if you want to use Bluetooth via
	  the shared transport driver over UART.

	  Say Y here to compile support for Bluetooth protocol driver into the
	  kernel or say M to compile it as module (btdrv).
