/*

* Texas Instruments TUSB422 Power Delivery

Required Properties:
- compatible - Must be "ti,tusb422-usb-pd"
- reg - I2C address of the device.
- ti,alert-gpio - Interrupt GPIO for the device.
- ti,src-settling-time-ms - Time in milliseconds the source power supply needs to settle after a voltage transition. (50 ms by default)
- ti,fast-role-swap-support - Fast role swap support: 0 = Not supported (default), 1 = Default Power, 2 = 1.5A, 3 = 3.0A.
- ti,pdo-priority - Source PDO selection priority: 0 = voltage, 1 = current, 2 = power.
- ti,role - Type-C Role: 0 = SRC, 1 = SNK, 2 = DRP.
- ti,rp-val - Source current advertisement: 0 = Default, 1 = 1.5A, 2 = 3.0A.
- ti,flags - Option Flags: 0 = none, 1 = Try.SRC, 2 = Try.SNK.

Optional Properties (true if defined, otherwise they are false):
- ti,usb-comm-capable - Sink and/or source is capable of USB data communication.
- ti,no-usb-suspend - Sink requests to continue its power contract during USB suspend.
- ti,usb-suspend-supported - Source indicates to sink that it should follow the USB 2.0 or USB 3.1 for suspend and resume.
- ti,externally-powered - Source is externally powered.
- ti,dual-role-data - Port is dual-role data capable and supports DR_Swap message.
- ti,higher-capability - Sink requires more than 5V to provide full functionality.
- ti,giveback-flag - Sink will respond to GotoMin message and reduce its load to the minimum operation current.
- ti,auto-accept-swap-to-dfp - Automatically accept data role swap request to host.
- ti,auto-accept-swap-to-ufp - Automatically accept data role swap request to device.
- ti,auto-accept-swap-to-source - Automatically accept power role swap request to source.
- ti,auto-accept-swap-to-sink - Automatically accept power role swap request to sink.
- ti,auto-accept-vconn-swap - Automatically accept VCONN swap request.

Optional Properties for TUSB422 EVM Power Control:
