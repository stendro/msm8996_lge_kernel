## A bit of info

In the mk2k-gold branch I have upstreamed kernel manually.
There where many corrections and catchup patches applied. Do a search for "edit:" to see most of the commits that I've changed.

Currently I'm working on the mk2k-platinum branch, this is a rebase onto the v11g G6 source.
The mk2k-gold branch has some problems with usb. I reverted few CAF patches and took gadget.c (drivers/usb/dwc3) up to linux stable.
This seemed to have fixed a fast-charging issue that caused it to drop out randomly, but introduced a mtp/pc connection bug.

G6: On this (platinum) branch, G6 will not boot for some unknown reason. To build for G6 see my [G6 Kernel] repository.
